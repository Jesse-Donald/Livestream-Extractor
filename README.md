# Livestream-Extractor
A small set of scripts used for automatically cutting down a YouTube Livestream and re-uploading a shortened version of it using the OpenLP WS / HTTP api, OBS Websockets and Google Sheets

Why Google Sheets?
This allows the extractor script to be run on a separate device on the local network with the OBS and OpenLP PC's which may become offline. This allows another machine to perform the trim after the program has finished regardless of if the other machines are online or not.
